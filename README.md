Utilizing the public digital elevation model provided by the National Geographic Information Institute, in conjunction with Skyview by Naver Map, we executed a comprehensive simulation within an real urban setting.
Employing the Wireless Insite ray tracing tool, we meticulously quntifierd the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) dynamics through a controlled movement along a determined route, within an environment housing a cluster of five BSs.

In each csv file, we compiled RSRP dataset originating from five BSs, leveraging 256 (16x16) beams along the 824 chosen data points.
