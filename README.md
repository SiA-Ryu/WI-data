# WI-data
Utilizing the public digital elevation model provided by the National Geographic Information Institute, in conjunction with Skyview by Naver Map, we executed a comprehensive simulation within an real urban setting.
Employing the Wireless Insite ray tracing tool, we meticulously quntifierd the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) dynamics through a controlled movement along a determined route, within an environment housing a cluster of five BSs.

In each csv file, we compiled RSRP dataset originating from five BSs.
Rows represent each point in the moving route, and columns represent 256 possible beam indices formed by using a 16x16 antenna. 
Each value is the measured RSRP when the corresponding beam is used at each point.
